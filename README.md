# The Vanderbilt Hustler: Classic Edition ðŸ“°

[The Vanderbilt Hustler](https://vanderbilthustler.com) is the official student newspaper of Vanderbilt University.

The Classic Edition is a reimagining of it in the style of The New York Times just because I could.

This is built with [unim.press](https://github.com/thesephist/unim.press) as a static, single page application, and uses the public Hustler Wordpress API.

Special thanks to [@diogoscf](https://github.com/diogoscf) for making Promises on my behalf (I'm simply not ready for that kind of commitment).
